# Install

## NodeJS

You need nodejs to recompile the front
end [https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.17.0/node-v16.17.0-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.17.0/node-v16.17.0-x64.msi)

## Python

You need python to run the flask
serve. [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-amd64.exe](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-amd64.exe)

## Starting the server

 

run `install.bat` the first time you install this on a new machine after installing python.



run `front_end.bat` to recompile changes to the front end. You do not have to stop the server to change the front end.


you can change translations in `/front_end/translated.json`. I suggest using something
like https://jsonformatter.org/json-editor or any json editor to keep the formatting correct.

Please only change that file. Make sure it's valid json.

Need to change the stuff after the triple print? Just swap out `/additional.pdf`


## User accounts

go to app.py and change the passwords
